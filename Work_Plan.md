Milestones for Video Game Sales 2016 Research Project
1) Formed a Team and Created Repository
    - Teamed up with peers from the same section of Stat 184.
    - Created a GitHub repository named appropriately following the format: Sec#_FP_Name1_Name2_Name3.

2) Repo Ownership and Access Setup
    - Made the Stat184-Spring2025 the repo owner and ensured all team members have write access.
    - Verified that the instructor has access to the repo.

3) Project Topic and Research Question Finalized
    - Chose the topic “Video Game Sales in 2016”.
    - Developed research questions such as: Which publishers and genres performed best in 2016? 
    - How do platform and region affect global sales?

4) Planned Work Timeline
    - Created a clear work plan and timeline for the project including task assignments and deadlines.

5) Data Source Located and Loaded
    - Used the provided 2016 video game sales dataset (uploaded as CSV).
    - Documented the provenance: source is likely from Kaggle, collected for analyzing industry sales performance.

6) Data Cleaning and Tidying
    - Loaded and cleaned the data using clean_names() from the janitor package.
    - Removed NAs from key fields such as global_sales, genre, publisher, and platform.

7) Exploratory Data Analysis Conducted
    - Explored distributions and trends by genre, publisher, platform, and region.
    - Identified patterns, such as the dominance of specific genres or regional variations.

8) Created Meaningful Data Visualizations
    - Generated bar charts, pie charts, and trend plots using ggplot2.
    - Included figures with captions and cross-references in the narrative.

9) Wrote Reproducible Report Using QMD
    - Report written in Quarto (QMD) with PDF output.
    - Code moved to a Code Appendix section using the recommended ref.label trick.

10) Described FAIR/CARE Principles
    - Evaluated dataset's openness, reuse potential, and relevance to the public.
    - Discussed any limitations in how the data meets these standards.

11) GitHub Version Control Used Properly

    - Collaborated via a dev branch and performed a pull request to merge into main.
    - Each team member made at least 2 commits, with proper documentation in the README.

12) Prepared for Work-in-Progress Presentation
    - Completed WIP presentation, sharing the project topic, one insight (e.g., Action games had the highest global sales), and one challenge (e.g., Missing publisher info for some entries).
