# Introduction
This project explores video game sales between 2000 and 2016.  
We aim to understand:
- What factors influence global sales?
- Are critic and user scores correlated with commercial success?
- How do sales differ by region and platform?

# Data Provenance
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), uploaded by a contributor for public analysis.  
It contains metadata about video game titles, platforms, genres, global/regional sales, and critic/user review scores.

# FAIR/CARE Principles
- **FAIR**: The dataset is accessible (CSV format), reusable, and clearly structured.
- **CARE**: No private data is used. Analysis is done ethically, solely for educational insights.

# Data Cleaning Summary
We performed the following preprocessing steps:
- Removed rows with missing or placeholder scores (`"tbd"`)
- Converted `user_score` to numeric
- Filtered out entries with `global_sales <= 0`
- Kept only platforms with ≥ 30 entries for score averaging

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Top Publishers by Global Sales
*Include table or plot showing top publishers*

## Average Scores by Platform
*Show a table of average critic and user scores for platforms with ≥ 30 games*

## Global Sales by Genre
*Bar chart of total sales by genre*

## Regional Sales Comparison
*Bar chart comparing sales across NA, EU, JP, and Other*

## Critic Score vs User Score
*Scatterplot with narrative on correlation*

## Boxplot: Top 5 Platforms
*Boxplot showing global sales distribution for the 5 top-selling platforms (log scale)*

## Genre Popularity by Region
*Faceted bar plot showing which genres sell best in NA, EU, JP*

# Insights and Conclusion
- **Sales are strongly driven by platform and genre.**
- **Critic scores show a positive correlation with global sales.**
- **Japan tends to prefer Role-Playing games, while NA prefers Action and Sports.**
- We were surprised by how much variance existed in user scores across platforms.
